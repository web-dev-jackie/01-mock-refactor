# Code Refactor for Mock Client

## Description

Horiseon Marketing is a mock client updating their existing codebase. This project is being built to exceed client expectations by integrating modern HTML and CSS. The main takeaways are organizing classes and id's within CSS and structuring HTML with tags that will aid in SEO, such as section and article. 

The client now has a base to start adding additional pages, components and features through HTML, CSS, JavaScript and beyond.
Additions include: 
- Breakpoints,
- Wrappers,
- Classes,
- Id's,
- Tags,
- Bootstrap grid and components.


As we're here to refactor code, we simply frame the HTML to include a navbar, jumbotron, one row with two columns and a footer. The internal navigtion uses anchor tags and id's to guide the user.
